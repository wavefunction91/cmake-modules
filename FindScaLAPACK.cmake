#   FindScaLAPACK.cmake
#
#   Finds the ScaLAPACK library.
#
#   This module will define the following variables:
#   
#     SCALAPACK_FOUND        - System has found ScaLAPACK installation
#     SCALAPACK_LIBRARIES    - ScaLAPACK libraries
#
#   This module will export the following targets if SUPERLU_FOUND
#
#     ScaLAPACK::scalapack
#
#
#
#
#   Proper usage:
#
#     project( TEST_FIND_SUPERLU C )
#     find_package( ScaLAPACK )
#
#     if( SCALAPACK_FOUND )
#       add_executable( test test.cxx )
#       target_link_libraries( test ScaLAPACK::scalapack )
#     endif()
#
#
#
#
#   This module will use the following variables to change
#   default behaviour if set
#
#     scalapack_PREFIX
#     scalapack_LIBRARY_DIR
#     scalapack_LIBRARIES
#
#
#   This module also calls FindLinAlg.cmake if no LinAlg::BLAS
#   TARGET is found. If this behaviour is not desired, ensure 
#   that there is a proper definition of LinAlg::BLAS prior
#   to invokation by either calling find_package( LinAlg ) 
#   or creating a user defined target which properly links to
#   blas
